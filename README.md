# Photo-Sharing Web Application with AWS Amplify

This repo contains all the source-code that results from working through the tutorial available [here](https://aws-fullstack-workshop.dcolcott.com/).

## Pre-requisites

If you want to execute / run locally, rather than using Cloud9, then you'll need to install the [Amplify CLI](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-cli).

## Usage

1. Run `amplify configure` to set your AWS access credentials, region and a new (or existing) user profile.
